# PyGFN: Quantum Chemistry Green's Function Methods

PyGFN is a Python package that provides a user-friendly interface for computing Green's functions using various quantum chemistry methods. 
It is built on top of the `pyscf` package and aims to simplify the process of obtaining Green's functions for different quantum systems.

## Features

- Compute Green's functions for quantum chemistry methods including HF, FCI, and CCSD.
- Abstracts the complexity of quantum chemistry computations, providing an intuitive API.
- Detailed documentation and usage examples for each supported method.
- Supports different input formats for molecules and customizable output formats.
